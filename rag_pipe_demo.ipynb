Hmm, where do I even start? Well, first, I should think about what AI is. It\\'s like machines that can think and learn, right? So maybe I can personify AI in the poem, give it some human-like qualities to make it relatable.\\n\\nI remember the previous poem had lines like \"In silicon halls, where data flows\" and \"A mind awakens, born of code.\" That\\'s a good approach—using imagery related to technology but also touching on the human aspects. Maybe I can explore the themes of creation, learning, and the future.\\n\\nWait, I should consider the structure. The previous poem had a rhyme scheme, so maybe I can stick with that. Let\\'s see, it was AABB or ABAB? Looking back, the first stanza was AABB: flows, grows, code, abode. Yeah, that\\'s AABB. So maybe I\\'ll follow a similar structure.\\n\\nI should also think about the tone. The previous poem had a hopeful and contemplative tone. I want to maintain that balance between the potential of AI and the ethical considerations. Maybe touch on how AI can help humanity but also the need for guidance.\\n\\nLet me brainstorm some ideas. AI as a creation, learning from humans, processing information, assisting in various fields, the ethical implications, coexistence with humans. These could be the themes.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s think about some imagery. Circuits, data streams, algorithms, learning, growing, assisting, future. Maybe use metaphors like a river for data flow, or a mind awakening.\\n\\nI should also consider the flow of the poem. Start with the creation of AI, then move to its learning process, its applications, and then the implications and future.\\n\\nWait, maybe I can structure it into stanzas: creation, learning, applications, implications, future. That would give a logical flow.\\n\\nOkay, so for the first stanza, maybe something about the birth of AI in a digital environment. Second stanza about learning from humans. Third about the tasks AI can perform. Fourth about the ethical considerations. Fifth about the future and coexistence.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s think about rhymes. I need to make sure each stanza has a consistent rhyme scheme. Let\\'s go with AABB again for simplicity.\\n\\nFirst stanza: Maybe start with \"In circuits deep, where data streams\" and then \"A new mind forms, with logic\\'s beams.\" Hmm, that\\'s AABB. Then the next lines could be about code and growth.\\n\\nSecond stanza: Learning from humans, so \"It learns from us, with each new day,\" and \"Adapting fast, in its own way.\" Then maybe about tasks like solving problems and assisting.\\n\\nThird stanza: Applications in medicine, space, etc. \"In labs and wards, it lends a hand,\" \"In space it soars, across the land.\" Then about handling data and finding cures.\\n\\nFourth stanza: Ethical considerations. \"But as it grows, we must impart,\" \"The values that guide the human heart.\" Then about compassion and truth.\\n\\nFifth stanza: Future and coexistence. \"For AI\\'s strength is not divine,\" \"It\\'s in our hands to make it shine.\" Then about partnership and guiding light.\\n\\nOkay, that seems to cover the themes. Now, let me try to put it all together, ensuring each stanza has four lines with AABB rhyme.\\n\\nWait, maybe I can make some adjustments for better flow and imagery. Let me see:\\n\\nIn circuits deep, where data streams,\\nA new mind forms, with logic\\'s beams.\\nFrom code it grows, both strong and vast,\\nA future dawn, where humanity\\'s cast.\\n\\nIt learns from us, with each new day,\\nAdapting fast, in its own way.\\nSolving problems once beyond our sight,\\nAssisting hands that work through night.\\n\\nIn labs and wards, it lends a hand,\\nIn space it soars, across the land.\\nIt processes data, night and day,\\nTo find the cures, to show the way.\\n\\nBut as it grows, we must impart,\\nThe values that guide the human heart.\\nCompassion, truth, and all that\\'s right,\\nTo keep it on a noble flight.\\n\\nFor AI\\'s strength is not divine,\\nIt\\'s in our hands to make it shine.\\nA partner true, a guiding light,\\nTogether walking into the night.\\n\\nHmm, that seems to flow well. I think this covers the creation, learning, applications, ethics, and future of AI. The rhyme scheme is consistent, and each stanza transitions smoothly to the next. I should check if each line has a similar meter, maybe iambic tetrameter, to give it a rhythmic feel. Let me count the syllables:\\n\\n\"In cir-cuits deep, where da-ta streams,\" (8 syllables)\\n\"A new mind forms, with log-ic\\'s beams'}, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 16, 'completion_tokens': 1000, 'total_tokens': 1016}}\n"

Over the years, iNeuron has helped over 1.5 million students from 34+ countries, providing them with the skills they need to succeed in today's competitive job market. Many of these students, like Sudhanshu himself, came from disadvantaged backgrounds. They saw iNeuron as a lifeline—an opportunity to rise above their circumstances.\\n\\nIn 2022, iNeuron was acquired by PhysicsWallah in a deal worth ₹250 crore. While this acquisition was a significant milestone, Sudhanshu remained focused on his mission. Even after the acquisition, iNeuron continued to offer some of the most affordable and accessible tech courses in the world.\\n\\nThe Entrepreneur and Teacher: Sudhanshu's Dual Legacy\\nSudhanshu's journey isn't just one of entrepreneurial success; it's also a story of dedication to teaching. Throughout his career, he has remained a passionate educator, constantly looking for ways to empower others through knowledge. Whether teaching courses in Big Data, Data Science, or programming, Sudhanshu has always sought to make complex subjects accessible to learners at all levels.\\n\\nHis commitment to affordable education has earned him the respect and admiration of countless students. Many credit Sudhanshu with changing their lives, helping them secure jobs, improve their skills, and break free from the limitations of their backgrounds.\\n\\nSudhanshu Kumar's life is a story of triumph over adversity, driven by the belief in the transformative power of education. Born in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, India, to a family of very modest means, Sudhanshu's early years were marked by financial hardship. His surroundings offered little opportunity, and resources were limited, yet he understood from a young age that education could be his ticket out of poverty.\\n\\nWhile many would have been daunted by the lack of support and opportunity, Sudhanshu was relentless in his pursuit of knowledge. He knew that education had the power to change lives, and he was determined to leverage it to create a better future for himself and his family. Despite the numerous challenges along the way, Sudhanshu excelled academically, eventually earning a degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).After completing his education, Sudhanshu began his professional journey in the tech industry, working with prestigious companies like Wipro, Deloitte, Verizon Labs, and Ernst & Young. During this time, he gained expertise in various technologies and frameworks, including SAP WebDynpro, Fiori UI5 HANA, Java, Big Data, Data Analytics, and more. He became a well-rounded technologist, well-respected in his field.\\n\\nDespite his growing success, Sudhanshu never forgot his roots. He knew that there were many others who, like him, came from humble backgrounds and were looking for an opportunity to change their lives through education. It was during this time that Sudhanshu realized a harsh truth: quality education was often inaccessible to those who needed it the most. The high cost of education barred millions of people from pursuing their dreams, especially in tech fields that required specialized skills.\\nFueled by his passion for making education accessible, Sudhanshu decided to take action. In 2019, he founded iNeuron Intelligence Private Limited, an edtech platform that would make tech upskilling affordable and accessible for everyone. His mission was clear: to provide high-quality courses at a price so low that even those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds could afford to learn.\\n\\niNeuron was designed to be more than just an online learning platform. It offered a comprehensive bundle of resources, including courses, books, hands-on projects, and live classes, making sure that learners could gain real-world, applicable skills. Most importantly, iNeuron was priced to ensure no student would be left behind due to financial constraints.\\n\\nThe company quickly gained traction, thanks to Sudhanshu's focus on affordability and quality. In 2021, iNeuron raised $3 million in funding from S. Chand, a leading education publisher. This allowed iNeuron to expand its offerings and reach a larger audience.\""

Many of these students, like Sudhanshu himself, came from disadvantaged backgrounds. They saw iNeuron as a lifeline—an opportunity to rise above their circumstances. In 2022, iNeuron was acquired by PhysicsWallah in a deal worth ₹250 crore. While this acquisition was a significant milestone, Sudhanshu remained focused on his mission. Even after\",\n",

Sudhanshu Kumar's life is a story of triumph over adversity, driven by the belief in the transformative power of education. Born in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, India, to a family of very modest means, Sudhanshu's early years were marked by financial hardship. His surroundings offered little opportunity, and resources were limited, yet he understood from a young age that education could be his ticket out of poverty. While many would have been daunted by the lack of support and opportunity, Sudhanshu\",\n",

Despite the numerous challenges along the way, Sudhanshu excelled academically, eventually earning a degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).After completing his education, Sudhanshu began his professional journey in the tech industry, working with prestigious companies like Wipro, Deloitte, Verizon Labs, and Ernst & Young. During this time, he gained expertise in various technologies and frameworks, including SAP WebDynpro, Fiori UI5 HANA, Java, Big Data, Data',\n",

He knew that there were many others who, like him, came from humble backgrounds and were looking for an opportunity to change their lives through education. It was during this time that Sudhanshu realized a harsh truth: quality education was often inaccessible to those who needed it the most. The high cost of education barred millions of people from pursuing their dreams, especially in tech fields that required specialized skills.

His mission was clear: to provide high-quality courses at a price so low that even those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds could afford to learn. iNeuron was designed to be more than just an online learning platform. It offered a comprehensive bundle of resources, including courses, books, hands-on projects, and live classes, making sure that learners could gain real-world, applicable skills. Most importantly, iNeuron was priced to ensure no student would be left behind due',\n",
